## Introduction
Welcome to my Daily DSA Practice repository! This project documents my journey in mastering Data Structures and Algorithms through consistent problem-solving, notes, and solutions. My goal is to strengthen my problem-solving skills and share my progress with others. Each day, I will solve a problem and upload my solution here, along with explanations and notes.


## Daily Progress
Below is a log of problems I’ve solved each day:

### Day 1: Getting Started With Algorithms
- **Problem 1**:- [FizzBuzz](https://leetcode.com/problems/fizz-buzz) - [Solution](Daily/FizzBuzz.py)
    -  **Description**: Fizz and Buzz refer to any number that's a multiple of 3 and 5 respectively. In other words, if a number is divisible
by 3, it is substituted with ﬁzz; if a number is divisible by 5, it is substituted with buzz. If a number is simultaneously
a multiple of 3 AND 5, the number is replaced with "ﬁzz buzz." In essence, it emulates the famous children game
"ﬁzz buzz".
<!-- - **Problem 2**: [Maximum Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray) - [Solution](arrays/maximum_subarray.py) -->
 -  **Description**: Fizz and Buzz refer to any number that's a multiple of 3 and 5 respectively. In other words, if a number is divisible

<!-- ### Day 2: Strings
- **Problem 1**: [Valid Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome) - [Solution](strings/valid_palindrome.py)
- **Problem 2**: [Longest Common Prefix](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-prefix) - [Solution](strings/longest_common_prefix.py)

### Day 3: Linked Lists
- **Problem 1**: [Reverse Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list) - [Solution](linked_lists/reverse_linked_list.py)

### Day 4: Dynamic Programming
- **Problem 1**: [Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs) - [Solution](dp/climbing_stairs.py) -->
